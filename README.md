This is not a real project. It's a course designed to help you learn JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js for backend development.

It simulates the real life software development, giving you opportunity to work on various types of coding work like bug fixes, feature developments, etc.

It's assumed you have:

- basic programming skills in at least one language (if you're absolutely new to development, please learn the basics first)
- basic understanding of backend development

It's NOT assumed you have:

- JavaScript knowledge
- TypeScript knowledge
- Node.js knowledge

## Motivation

From my personal experience and anecdotes from others, the best way to learn development is by getting hands-on experience. However, not all of us are fortunate enough to learn and get paid at the same time. Also, if you're joining a big or mature project, it can be daunting to start contributing right away without prior knowledge.

You could start a new toy project on your own, but the initial project setup is often the most frustrating part, especially if you're not familiar with the teck stack. Unless you're familiar with it, you most likely won't be the first person writing code on that project. So this course lets you start from the middle stage of the project, just like you will likely do in real life development.

## Tasks

The following are all independent tasks, so they can be worked on in any order. They are however, in increasing order of difficulty.
